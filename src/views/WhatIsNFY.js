As of now, DeFi is dominated by ERC-20 tokens, which are fungible tokens, meaning that all are the same and are not unique from one another. While ERC-20 tokens are surely needed and are not going to be going away anytime soon, there are many other different token standards that are rarely mentioned, ERC-721 being one of them. ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible tokens, meaning that each token is unique and no two are like, this is because of the unique token id that each token is given at the time of being minted. Currently, ERC-721 tokens are mostly used as collectibles, the Non-Fungible Yearn platform will re-imagine how these tokens have been used by creating a use case for them in DeFi.</Typography>
